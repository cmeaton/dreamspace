I was running away from something that I do not remember, only knowing that I was in danger. I was hitch hiking and got a ride from a man in an old truck. We drove for a long time until we got to a fork in the road. I asked him if this is where the chimera zone was, pointing to the steep hill of a road straight through the intersection. He said yes and with fear, told me that I shouldnt go in there because it was very dangerous. No one who went in came out he said. I knew this and was okay with it, for it was preferred over being caught by the group chasing me. I got out and ran across the road and climbed the hill to get in. It didn't look steep, but the road was so steep that I had to climb by grabbing the pushes as handholds on the side. When I climbed to the top, the road was so steep and the decline on the other side was so steep that I was able to straddle the top. I sat at the top with legs over both sides, took a final look at he concerned man who helped me, and then swung my legs over into the dark, heavily vegetated chimera zone. It was like a rainforest and I saw a flower that was half white and half red, with the colors splitting perfectly down the middle.
