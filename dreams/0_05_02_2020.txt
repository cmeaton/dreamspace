My cousins, who are already married in real life, were getting married in a western, rustic barn. Everything felt grey and brown. My aunt asked me to write and read a poem about my cousins' love and marriage. Apparently I obliged and done so previously, but I wrote it on a birch catkin, not paper. I lost the birch catkin and embarrassingly had to search for it on the floor when I was called to read. Eventually I found it, trampled and worn. While I cannot remember seeing any words written on it, I was able to read the poem. It was terrible and choppy and I was embarrased of its poor quality. Part way through, the wedding continued before I was done and everyone ignored me. My mom and grandmother got up and did a silly dance next and everyone loved it. I felt embarrassed.
