I dreamt that I was floating down a river, grey with glacial silt, through a beautiful mountain valley, with some fairly uninhabited farm land around. It was fun, like recreational tubing. I was with some of my family members and I think Joe Rogan. We floated by a peaceful looking fawn foraging in the brush. shortly after, wolves ran out from the fields. We were all scared they would hurt us and they looked mean. We picked up rocks and to throw at the wolves. Fortunately, we realized the wolves wouldnt come into the water, so we were safe. However, we noticed dogs from a nearby ranch were swimming down the river to hurt us. My aunt had a baseball bat and she gave it to me and I hit and attacked the dogs.
