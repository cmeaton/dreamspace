I was in the reddish brown desert of Utah or Colorado on a hill side with large rocks everywhere. It was very crowded and appeard to be a mining operation. Below, an impressive array of dynamite was set off the the explosion was orderly, loud, and exciting. Shortly after, a rock slide started. It started below me and I watched from safety. It was very large and many huge rocks fell. It looked like people were getting injured. As I noticed that, I looked up and saw the rock slide starting above me. I hid under the steep face of a small cliff and was protected. Every once in a while I would look up, only to have a massive rock fly right by my head and I would duck again. This went on for some time until someone shouted the rocks had stopped. They pointed out a road to the top of the hill and we climbed it to safety. We had to run but I was worried about a calf injury I had in real life, but it was fine. At the top, there were many people and well organized ultramarathon appeard to be happening. I was invited to join. While I hesitated due to my injury and the frightening situation, not knowing if it was safe or not, I joined for the down hill portion. It was great fun. There was a river crossing at the bottom over loose logs. At one point in the middle, there was a log that would only support 2 people but I was with hannah and sadie. I volunteered to have them cross safely and I would swim. I swam until the next log where I climbed to safety with great difficulty.
